# ShapeCheat
The Most Advanced Geometry Calculator!

## Description
This folder contains files for shapes and is already functioning well. Editing the code is unneccessary though the code is entirely free to use and licensed under Creative Commons. This project is meant to speed up your job and do for you the calculations that take time. It can work out:
- Volume
- Surface Area
- Lateral Surface Area
- Slant Height

Depending on the shape you choose. Project is still on BETA and is not fully released meaning there is room for improvement, and the code can definitely become more functional and flexible.

## Use
You must first download the file or clone the repository

### Cloning Repository
This is the easier method but you will need a few things already setup and fixed
#### Installing Git

```
Note: Before you use the above code, make sure your directory was already changed to the place you would like to clone the code into. By default it is set to C:/Users/yourname
